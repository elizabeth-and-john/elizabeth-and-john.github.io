# Lyons, Colorado &mdash; 19 August 2018

Boulder will be our home base for the Colorado celebration, and we encourage you
to stay in town! Lyons is just 30 minutes north of Boulder, and halfway in
between Boulder and Estes Park. (Estes Park is home to Rocky Mountain National
Park, and also an option to consider when seeking accommodations.) We will have
shuttles to and from Lyons on the 19th.

### Where to Stay
We have arrangements with the following hotels. (TODO: Add details)
  * Residence Inn Boulder
  * Courtyard Boulder
  * Hilton Garden Inn
  * Embassy Suites

### Travel Information
Denver International Airport is 45 minutes from Boulder. There is a good bus
option to get to Boulder from the airport, and Boulder is easy to navigate by
foot and bus.
