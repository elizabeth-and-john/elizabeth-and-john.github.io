| Colorado | Colombia |

| 19 August, 2018 | 8 September, 2018 |
| Lyons, Colorado | Bogotá, Colombia |

### Where to Stay
Boulder will be our home base for the Colorado celebration, and we encourage you
to stay in town! Lyons is just 30 minutes north of Boulder, and halfway in
between Boulder and Estes Park. (Estes Park is home to Rocky Mountain National
Park, and also an option to consider when seeking accommodations.)

### Travel Information
Denver International Airport is 45 minutes from Boulder. There is a good bus
option to get to Boulder from the airport, and Boulder is easy to navigate by
foot and bus. We will have shuttles to and from Lyons on the 19th.

Americans traveling to Colombia do not need visas. Bogotá is the capital and
largest city in Colombia. At 8,600ft it is at a higher elevation than our
Boulder celebration. Expect cool weather (highs in the 60s, lows in the 40s
Fahrenheit) and little rain&mdash;although September is not the driest month, it
is not part of the rainy season. The elevation also puts Bogotá outside the
habitat of the Aedes mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting many
diseases including the Zika virus. Since Bogotá is above 6,500ft, the [CDC
considers it as having a low likelihood of Zika
infection](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/world-map-areas-with-zika), and as
of January 2016, [the only reported cases of Zika in Bogotá had been contracted
elsewhere](http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-16494219).
